# Main-Supercollider-Files


All codes were written by me from scratch. Except SOSkick, SOSsnare, SOShats, SOStoms but I developed them further for my needs. Most of the code is only useful with my sequencer Sequentix Cirklon but it is still possible to use parts with SynthDefs for one's own use. Comments may be written in Turkish. GNU License file will be added later.
